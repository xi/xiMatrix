		<p>In the table above, the columns represent different types of requests. The rows represent domains. Numbers show how many requests of a given type the current tab tries to make to the given domain. Red cells are blocked, green cells are allowed. Light green cells are allowed indirectly, e.g. because they represent a sub-domain of an allowed domain. Grey cells are disabled.</p>
		<p>By default, everything is blocked. You can click on a cell to allow it. You can also click on the domain or type to allow the complete row or column. There are also some special rows:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>inline</strong>: This row is in charge of blocking inline code, e.g. <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-elements that are directly embedded into the HTML code. Note that some cells are disabled, e.g. there is no such thing as an "inline XHR".</li>
			<li><strong>first-party</strong>: This row allows you to set global defaults for requests to the same domain as the page itself.</li>
			<li><strong>sub-domains</strong>: If you allow a domain, all of its sub-domains are allowed along with it.</li>
		</ul>
